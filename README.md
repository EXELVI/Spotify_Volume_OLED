This project uses an OLED display to visualize and control the volume of your Spotify playback devices using a physical rotary encoder.

## üìú Overview

**Spotify Volume OLED** allows you to monitor and adjust the volume of your Spotify playback devices using an Arduino-based setup. The project features a rotary encoder to change the volume, and an OLED display to visualize the volume level and device status.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Volume Control**: Adjust the volume of your Spotify devices in real-time.
- **OLED Display**: Visualizes the current volume level, device name, and Wi-Fi connection status.
- **Rotary Encoder Interface**: Simple and intuitive volume control using a rotary encoder.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
- 0.96" OLED Display (SSD1306)
- Rotary Encoder
- LED Matrix Display 

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EXELVI/Spotify_Volume_OLED.git
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    Make sure to install the following Arduino libraries:
    - `Adafruit GFX Library`
    - `Adafruit SSD1306`
    - `Arduino_JSON`
    - `WiFi`
    - `ArduinoGraphics`
    - `Arduino_LED_Matrix`

3. **Configure Secrets**:
    Create a file named `arduino_secrets.h` and add your WiFi credentials and Spotify API credentials:
    ```cpp
    #define SECRET_SSID "your-SSID"
    #define SECRET_PASS "your-password"
    #define SECRET_CLIENT_ID "your-spotify-client-id"
    #define SECRET_CLIENT_SECRET "your-spotify-client-secret"
    #define SECRET_BASE64 "your-base64-auth"
    ```

## üìã Usage

1. **Upload the Sketch**:
    Upload the Arduino sketch to your board using the Arduino IDE.

2. **Connect to Wi-Fi**:
    The device will attempt to connect to the Wi-Fi network using the credentials provided.

3. **Authorize Spotify**:
    Access the provided URL from the OLED display using a web browser to authorize your Spotify account.

4. **Control the Volume**:
    Use the rotary encoder to adjust the volume and observe the changes on the OLED display.
